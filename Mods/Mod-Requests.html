Endless mode is cool but I think it's better for high-level prisoners and very rare stuff like dragon scales than for farming basic potions and scrolls, and digging+exploring just to find a couple of golden chests at a time is also very slow, idk.

        <div class="content">Hello, I was thinking about posting this in ⁠ideas but I'm not sure how plausible this actually is so I figured it would work better as a mod, but how about adding in a water faction like mermaids and the such so that water actually has more of a purpose and digging pits isn't mainly just for aesthetic value? Or to a lesser extent, pirates of some kind. I'm asking because I'd like to see water have more of a role overall and to increase NPC variety. If something like this already exists or has been requested, feel free to tell me how dumb I am.</div>

It is really good that Game Dungeon is maintaining Bonus Mod for the community. Trillon and I were saying how we like a long tech tree and I am considering a mod that adds a playable faction to allow the keeper to assimilate techs from other factions - to build furniture, craft and gain immigrants by first assimilating a tech that unlocks that faction's technologies. I am asking for any thoughts on how or if this should be done. Upvote if it seems cool.</div>
