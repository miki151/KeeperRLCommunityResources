# Spells.txt - Checklist
#############################
# 1) Give every spell a custom description and a custom name
# 2) Consider using endonly for each ranged spell to avoid hitting everything in it's path. Make the choice depend on balancing the spell.
# 3) Consider using spell speed stat for each spell using {} on cooldown. Not necessarily for all spells.
# 4) Consider creating new buffs when spells use an existing buff. Give the new buffs better descriptions and names etc.
# 5) Carefully consider which stats to buff. eg. Do you want a defense or parry buff?
# 6) Get the best sprites for creatures using or being used by spells
# 7) Consider using sprite variants
# 8) Find the best UNICode characters supported by KeeperRL for the spells. Go easy on using ASCII
