P("There are now many different types of Keepers you may face and each have their own strengths and weaknesses.")
P("The minions use different rooms in different ways.")
P("Some rooms have things to hide behind. Cages, beds etc. Adventurers and some werewolves can hide and sneak attack or just choose enemies to pick off that walk past.")
P("Dining Table - Build one to keep your minions buffed but this is a great place to visit in an enemy dungeon. Kill the enemy when he gets hungry and comes for lunch - one by one.")
P("Workshops - Build basic weapons and armour. By the time you encounter enemy workshops they normally produce nothing useful. Knock them down to prevent cheap weapons being made.")
P("Laboratories - Build yourself these if you can and make yourself potions. Leave enemy keepers with little minions happily making potions. You can usually acquire them yourself later.")
P("Beds - You need these to recruit monsters and keep them alert (buffed). When invading, catch monsters in their sleep. When you have cleared the dormitory, pick off monsters one by one as they enter for a nap. Finally, burn down the dormitory so the keeper can't recruit new humanoids.")
P("Forges - There is almost always a surplus of weapons and armour in the late game. Ignore them. Kill inhabitants. Pick off workers as they enter.")
P("Jewellers - Amulets and rings. Not useful unless you missed these from the start.")
P("Ritual rooms - These are popular places for creatures to hang out in a fully developed dungeon, the numbers here may be heavily stacked against you.")
P("Beast lairs - Often no need to kill the weak monsters sleeping in here. Werewolves and legendary beasts can cause a problem and are worth killing if you can.")
P("Coffins - Kill undead when they go to their coffins to sleep. New undead tend to train and you don't want that really either.")
P("Wooden floors and other furniture can be burnt to the ground with torches.")
P("Weaken down the army as much as possible before trying to sort out the main areas.")
P("If the keepers or other bosses are living in a main area avoid taking them on surrounded by healers and other supporting units.")
P("Flaming swords are good at burning rooms down during combat, once you have fire resistance.")
P("Burn creatures alive if you can.")
