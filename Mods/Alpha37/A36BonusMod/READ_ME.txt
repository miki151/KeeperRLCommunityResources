Dear reader,

In KeeperRL, modding the software is achieved by making sprites and changing the game configuration.

I have put mod tiles and graphics into GitHub, although in some cases the tiles have a complicated history with licensing (modified stock graphics).

I purchased a license for the stock graphics used originally by KeeperRL in the main game. You get one from here:

https://www.oryxdesignlab.com/

So all the graphics are not necessarily under GNU although I have a right to use and modify them in my works.
The relevant tiles can be downloaded in-game and are not necessarily distributable outside specific conditions.

Thanks for your understanding.
