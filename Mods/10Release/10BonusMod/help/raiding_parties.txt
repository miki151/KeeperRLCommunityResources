P("How to tackle the boulder/web combination")
P("___________________________________________________________")
P("")
P("These are very tough in Adventurer Mode without a spying ring or if you have no way to disarm traps when attacking a dungeon. If there is a boulder trap with a web trap in front and you get webbed, you must use any teleport spell immediately. Without that you will die to the boulder. If you already know that trap is on the map, then herd wildlife into it. They will die not you. Alternatively, trigger the trap using deception, flies or summoning spells.")
P("")
P("Some maps force you to play 'Indiana Jones' with the traps.")
P("")
P("Lone boulder trap: Often you are able to trigger the trap and then step aside. If not, treat it the same way as a boulder web combo and trigger the trap without stepping too near it.")
